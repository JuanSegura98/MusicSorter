# MusicSorter
A Python script to help sort a bunch of .mp3 files. It's purpose is to be quick and able to deal with a big number of files.

The only needed configuration is to change the music path in the global variable MUSIC_PATH to your own. Then, run the script and it will automatically decide where to move each song (Artist folder). If it does not exist, it will ask you. If you answer no, a bigger menu will appear, with more options (rename song, select existing folder or skip the song).
